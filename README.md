html5 player for raw h.264 streams. 
================
 
 A javascript library which implements websocket client for watching and focusing on raw h.264 live streams in your browser that works directly on top of a standard HTML5 element and MediaSource Extensions. 
 
 It works by transmuxing H264 NAL unit into ISO BMFF (MP4) fragments.

 Adjusted framerate to 25Hz.

 Adjusted to display directly.

 Added ws address when init a Wfs().

 Use babel 7.
