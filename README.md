html5 player for raw h.264 streams. 
================
 
 A javascript library which implements websocket client for watching and focusing on raw h.264 live streams in your browser that works directly on top of a standard HTML5 element and MediaSource Extensions. 
 
 It works by transmuxing H264 NAL unit into ISO BMFF (MP4) fragments.

 I removed the original websockets proxy server. I wrote another proxy to fetch and send h264 NAL unit from rtsp streams. My server sends  one NAL unit at a time, so I simplified the original code as there is no need to find units in the ws messages. My server code is not based on the original one and is not included. The server side is much easier than this js code ðŸ˜“.

 Other changes:
 
 1. Adjusted display framerate to 25Hz according to my rtsp sources.

 2. Added ws address when init a Wfs().

 3. Removed all file handle things. ONLY H264 allowed.
 
 4. Changed to babel 7.
